# Kickstarter_analysis
Analysis of Kickstarter looking for trends and information before start a new project

## Overview of Project
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Purpose
This report analyze the fundraising for kickstarting projects as a guideline for future investments. 
## Analysis and Challenges
From the data of any kind of Kickstarting projects around the world, between 2009 and 2017, we analized projects, to find any relation between their launch date and their recaudation goals.  We select theather plays because that is our Client´s principal interest. 
### Analysis of Outcomes by Launch Date
We display data grouped by month of release and outcomes, looking if ther is a relation between plays´s launch date and its success. Later we plot a chart to visualize which month has most lauched (and successful) plays. Kickstarte_challenge/TeatherOutcomesByLaunchedDate.xlsx
### Analysis of Outcomes 
In this case we displayed the plays divided for its recaudation goal and outcomes and from the we  calculate the percentage of successful, failed  an canceled plays, looking for its trends.    Kickstarter.xls/OutcomesBasedOnGoal.xlsx

## Results
### A) About Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launched Date (2)
First, we can see that although the period from April to August is where the most plays are released, May and June are prefered for premieres.
Second, we can also observe that although in general, a third of the plays  released are not successful, May and June have a tendency to have more successful works than failed.
### B) About Outcomes based on Goals
One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals (2 pt).
From the chart we can see that for plays with a goal of less than $25,000 USD there are 50 percent of successful, and this percentage begins to decrease as higher collection goals are set, with some exceptions.
### C) limitations of the dataset
There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for additional tables or graphs (2 pt)

Although the first chart shows that the plays premiered in the months of May and June have fared better, it does not show the percentage of successful works. I would recomend this chart (see Percentage of premieres of works by release date tab in Kickstarter_challenge.xlsx). HEre we can see that this percentage is practically the same throughout the year, except for the months of December, January and August. From here we can recommend to our Client not to make his premiere in these particular months.
In the case of the second graph, I consider that although the collection goal shows that the higher it is, the more likely it is not to be successful, what we can do is that setting a more attainable goal allows it to be met.
