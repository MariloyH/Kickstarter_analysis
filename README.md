# Challenge 1. Kickstarter Analysis 
We will analize dataset of projects looking for trends and information about Theater fundraising. 

## Overview of Project
Louise is a Client who has been produced  theater plays and now she wants information that help her in future projects. 
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. We will use a dataset with information of different types of projects produced in different locations between 2009 and 2017. 

## Purpose
This report analyze the fundraising goals a its outcomes for kickstarting project.  
## Analysis and Challenges
From the data of any kind of Kickstarting projects around the world, between 2009 and 2017, we analized data to find any relation between Theater plays launch date and their recaudation goals, and we study their overcomes: if the play was successful or not. For this project, we will use Microsoft Excel 365.

In this case we have these Challenges:  first, it coulbe be better ir the dataset could include data more recent, because it reached  until 2017. Second, It could help if we could know where the Client wants to produce her play so we can get more specific information. 

### Analysis of Outcomes by Launch Date
We display data grouped by month of release and outcomes, looking if ther is a relation between plays´s launch date and its success. Later we plot a chart to visualize which month has most lauched (and successful) plays. 

See Kickstart_challenge/TeatherOutcomesByLaunchedDate.xlsx
### Analysis of Outcomes 
In this case we displayed the plays divided for its recaudation goal and outcomes and from the we  calculate the percentage of successful, failed  an canceled plays, looking for its trends.   See Kickstarter.xls/OutcomesBasedOnGoal.xlsx

## Results
### A) About Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
![T](https://github.com/MariloyH/Kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Theather_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launched Date: 
First, we can see that although the period from April to August is where the most plays were released, May and June had more successful plays.
Second, we can also observe that although in general, a third of the plays  released are not successful, May and June have a tendency to have more successful work than failed.

### B) About Outcomes based on Goals
![ ](https://github.com/MariloyH/Kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals:
From the chart we can see that for plays with a goal of less than $25,000 USD there are 50 percent of successful, and this percentage begins to decrease as higher collection goals are set, with some exceptions. So we sugest to set a fundraising goal of less than this amount. 
### C) Limitations of the dataset
For the purposes of this work, I think the data is enough because our Client wants informtion about past releases, but if she wants to make an invest due this results, we suggest some issues: 
Although the first chart shows that the plays premiered in the months of May and June have fared better, it does not show the percentage of successful works. We cant took the data from the Theater Outccomes by Lauched Date and calculate the percentage of successful goals (See %SuccessfulbyLaunched Date tab on Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) Here we can observe that the successful rate is practically the same throughout the year, with a small decrease during  December, January and August (probably due vacation period). From here,  we can suggest there is another determinant facts than the Launched Date.
In the case of the second  limitation is that although the funding goal shows that the higher it is, the more likely it is not to be successful, what we can do is that setting a more attainable goal allows it to be met. If take a Statistical look to the specific Theatre Plays Data,  (See TeatherFundraisingStats tab in Kickstarter_challenge.xlsx), we can see that the Median  the fundraising goal for successful plays is $6,124.37 USD and the MEAN of the pledge is $3,160.22 USD, so we can suggest to establish a reasonable fundraising these two values.
